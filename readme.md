## Create AWS EC2 Instance

This script will create an aws ec2 micro instance along with a keypair for it and print out the instance ID and public IP address.

REQUIREMENTS: awscli, boto3, python, pip

You must have already run the "aws configure" command and have that setup. 
The instanceId: AMI can be grabbed from aws console for your particular region
